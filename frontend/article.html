                <p class="lead">A monsoon is traditionally a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding
                    changes in precipitation. The term is now used to describe large-scale seasonal changes in
                    atmospheric circulation and precipitation occurring in certain parts of the world.</p>

                        In whispered arcs the seasons spin,
                        A circle carved in bark and skin.
                        One tree, two worlds‚Äîboth fierce and fair,
                        Split by light, and crowned by air.

                        üåÖ On one side, autumn softly bleeds,
                        With copper leaves and sleeping seeds.
                        The soil sighs beneath bare toes,
                        Where shadow dreams and stillness grows.

                        üå± On the other, spring ignites the green,
                        A breath of life, serene, unseen.
                        New grasses rise in vibrant grace,
                        The sky reborn in nature‚Äôs face.

                        üåó Ice and fire, dusk and dawn,
                        In sacred balance, life goes on.
                        Though branches bend through time and trial,
                        They meet again in perfect spiral.

                        So spins the soul, so flows the year,
                        In silent truth both far and near.
                        A single tree, a world apart‚Äî
                        Still rooted deep in nature‚Äôs heart.

                        I stood alone where time stood still,
                        A thousand skies behind one will.
                        The dawn, the dusk, the silent night,
                        All spilled their truth in shifting light.

                        Each panel breathed a fleeting hue‚Äî
                        A storm, a spark, a sky of blue.
                        Moments danced like whispered grace,
                        In this sacred, mirrored space.

                        From fire of eve to starry deep,
                        Where dreams awaken, others sleep‚Äî

                        Yet felt the whole call out my name.

                        For though the skies may change above,
                        Within me stirs the same old love‚Äî

                        <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
                        <p>The etymology of the word monsoon is not wholly certain. The English <em>monsoon</em> came
                            from Portuguese <em>mon√ß√£o</em> ultimately from Arabic <em>mawsim</em> ("season").</p>

                        <p>The English word monsoon comes from the Portuguese word <em> mon√ß√£o. </em></p>

                        <p> Mon√ß√£o itself was borrowed from the Arabic word ŸÖŸàÿ≥ŸÖ (mawsim), meaning ‚Äúseason‚Äù.</p>

                        <p> The Arabic mawsim was widely used by Arab sailors in the Indian Ocean to describe the
                            seasonal winds that changed direction each year and guided navigation.</p>

                        <h2 id="history" style="margin-top: 20px;">History</h2>
                        <p>Strengthening of the Asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau after
                            the collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asia around 50 million years ago.</p>

                        <p>The concept of monsoons has been documented since ancient times, with the term derived from
                            the Arabic word mausim, meaning season.
                            The first scientific studies of monsoon winds were conducted by Arab scholars, like
                            Al-Masudi,
                            who described seasonal wind and ocean current reversals. Sir Edmond Halley later proposed
                            the thermal contrast theory in 1686, explaining the differential heating of land and sea as
                            the cause of monsoons,
                            a concept that has evolved with modern meteorological research. </p>

                            <li> <b> Origin of the Term: </b> The word "monsoon" comes from the Arabic word mausim or
                                mausam, which means "seasonal winds". </li>
                            <li> <b> Early Observers: </b> Early writings by Greek, Indian, Buddhist, and Arab scholars
                                mention monsoons, highlighting their importance for ancient navigation and trade. </li>

                        <h2 id="process" style="margin-top: 20px;">Process</h2>
                        <p>Monsoon circulation is driven by differential heating between the land and the ocean, leading
                            to seasonal reversal of wind direction and precipitation patterns.</p>


                        <h2 id="global" style="margin-top: 20px;">Global Monsoon</h2>
                        <p>The global monsoon system is the unified, global-scale pattern of seasonal wet and dry
                            periods driven by the annual variation of the Earth's solar radiation and the coupled
                            ocean-atmosphere system.
                            It describes the combined large-scale overturning of the atmosphere in the tropics and
                            subtropics that influences precipitation across various regions worldwide,
                            including Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas. This system is characterized by a
                            seasonal shift in wind and rainfall patterns, with distinct regional components (like the
                            Asian, African, and North American monsoons) embedded within the larger global phenomenon.
